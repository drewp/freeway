plan 1:

Display speed data in a way that shows a few recent speeds too, so I
can see if a slow area is moving or not. 


plan 2:

After every freeway drive you do, find a computer and fill out my survey:

  1. What exits did you start/end with?

  2. Was the traffic bad enough that you would have wanted an alert to
     go another way?

After a while, I should be able to start sending you alerts if i think
you were about to start the drive and the traffic behavior is above
your threshold.

plan 3:

Draw the usual map, but then simulate little cars driving on it at the
correct speeds. Maybe this will be easier to read than the usual
green/yellow/red stuff.
